# Customer Sentiment Analysis

This project aims to analyze customer reviews using various Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The system utilizes Vader's Sentiment Analysis, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithms to classify and understand the sentiment expressed in the reviews. Additionally, the project includes a frontend and backend developed using Flask, a Python web framework.
